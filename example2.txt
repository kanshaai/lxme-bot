Aniket, the transaction seems to be in a processing state. The money involved will either get credited to the destination account or automatically reversed to the source account.
We’ve seen instances where sometimes, the receiver’s bank does not acknowledge the transfer or there’s a sudden surge in the network traffic.
I request you to wait till 3rd July 2024, 11.59 PM, failing which you can reach out to us to troubleshoot the issue for you.
This could occur as there beneficiary bank server is unresponsive or there is a reconciliation process being down, increased traffic at our bank server due to which we are unable to receive the final status of the Txn.
Please be assured, your money is safe.
We are keeping this chat open till you get the reversal.
You do not have to follow up; we will proactively contact you on this chat to share an update about the transaction status.
If you have any further queries related to this concern, all you need to do is go to the 'HELP' icon and re-open this conversation to make it easy for us to serve you better.

This delay can happen if the receiver’s bank does not acknowledge the transfer or if there’s a surge in network traffic. Please wait until 3rd July 2024, 11:59 PM. If the issue persists beyond this time, we will troubleshoot the matter for you.

Rest assured, your money is safe. We will keep this chat open until the transaction is resolved and will proactively update you on the status.
