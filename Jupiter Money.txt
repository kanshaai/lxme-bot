Content: If you encounter a situation where money has not been credited to your account or the receiver's account within 10 minutes, here are the steps you should follow according to Jupiter Money's policies and community guidelines:

1. **Wait for a Short Duration**: Sometimes, transactions may experience slight delays. Waiting an additional 10-20 minutes could resolve the issue.

2. **Check Transaction History**: Verify whether the transaction is visible in your transaction history. If the balance is updated but the transaction is not yet shown, it might be a synchronization issue.

   - **Email**: Reach out to Jupiter Money's customer support via their official email.
   - **In-App Support**: Utilize the in-app support feature to chat with a representative.
   - **Community Forum**: You can also raise your issue on the Jupiter Community Forum where other users or support staff might provide assistance.

4. **Provide Transaction Details**: When contacting support, ensure you provide:
   - Transaction ID
   - Date and time of the transaction
   - Amount transferred
   - Receiver’s details

5. **Monitor for Updates**: Jupiter Money aims to address transaction issues on a priority basis. Keep an eye on any updates from the support team regarding your issue.

6. **Refund Process**: If the transaction remains unresolved and the money is debited from your account, Jupiter Money may initiate a refund process. You might be advised to contact the merchant directly if applicable.

7. **Escalation**: If your issue is not resolved satisfactorily, you can escalate it through higher channels within Jupiter Money’s support framework.

For detailed information and updates, you can visit the [Jupiter Money Community Forum](https://community.jupiter.money) and [Jupiter Money Terms and Conditions](https://jupiter.money/terms-and-conditions/).
