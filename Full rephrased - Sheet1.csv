This is a joke! I'm gonna have to go to the bank and stand in line for hours because of this!","I understand your frustration, [User Name]. Let's see what's happening with the recurring payment setup. Could you please share the details of the bill payment you're trying to set up?

40,"It's for BSES, the amount is 2000 rupees, and the account number is [Account Number]. It's supposed to be a monthly payment, but this system is driving me crazy! What is wrong with your app?","Thank you for providing the details. I've checked the system, and it seems there might be a temporary issue with our recurring payment feature for BSES. We're working on resolving it as soon as possible. In the meantime, you can still make a manual payment through the app. Would you like to proceed with a one-time payment for your electricity bill now?",,,,,,,
