Content: ANZ Banking Group, officially known as the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited, traces its origins back to the early 19th century.

This marked the beginning of what would eventually become ANZ Banking Group. Over the years, ANZ has grown through various mergers and acquisitions, including a significant merger in 1970 between the Australia and New Zealand Bank Limited and the English, Scottish and Australian Bank Limited.
