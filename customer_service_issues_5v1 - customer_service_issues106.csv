In addition to your chosen refund or credit, we will review and update our website to make fee information clearer. We value your business and want to retain you as a satisfied customer.

If you have any further questions or concerns, please reach out to me directly at [contact information]. I'm here to help."
Fee Transparency & Disclosure,"This is outrageous! You guys are charging me a whopping 10% fee for an international transfer! That's ridiculous!

Can you confirm the amount you transferred, the currency involved, the recipient's country, and the date of the transaction?"

You were charged a £15 fee. Our policy states that transfers under £100 within the European Economic Area (EEA) are fee-free.

Loan Security & Collateral,"I'm furious! You guys are holding my loan hostage! I thought I qualified for this loan, but now you're asking for collateral I don't have! This is ridiculous! I'm going to file a complaint with the authorities!",I'm really sorry to hear how you're feeling. Let's discuss the specifics of the loan requirements and find a way to move forward. Could you please tell me what type of loan you're applying for and why the collateral request feels particularly unreasonable to you?
Loan Security & Collateral,"I'm absolutely furious! I applied for a personal loan with Jupiter, and you're asking for my car as collateral? That's completely unreasonable! I'm not going to risk my car for a loan, especially not with interest rates like yours! This is outrageous!",Collateral is often required for larger loans to help reduce risk for the lender and keep interest rates lower. We definitely don’t want to put you in an uncomfortable position. Can you tell me more about your specific concerns and the nature of the loan you’re applying for?
Loan Security & Collateral,"Unreasonable? It's ridiculous! I need this loan for my business, and now you're making me put my car on the line? What if something happens to my car? I can't afford to lose it! This is just a way to get more money from me!","Risking your car would be a significant concern, especially if it's your only means of transportation. Considering your business is an online shop, we might have specialized loan products designed for small online businesses that don't require a vehicle as collateral. Would you be open to exploring these options?"
Loan Security & Collateral,"My business is a small online shop, and I need a loan of ₹10 lakhs. I can't afford to lose my car for that! It's my only means of transportation. What other options are there?","₹10 lakhs is indeed a significant amount for a small business. Given that your loan is for your online shop, could we explore using your business inventory or future sales as collateral? Additionally, we have experts who specialize in business loans for online shops and could provide more tailored advice. Would you like me to connect you with one of them?"
Loan Security & Collateral,"A smaller loan or shorter term won't work for my business! I need the full amount and the longer term to make the necessary investments. I'm not sure what else I can offer as collateral. If this is your only option, I'm going to have to look elsewhere for a loan.","If using business inventory or future sales isn't feasible either, we could consider a co-signer. If someone else is willing to take responsibility for the loan with you, it might help us waive the collateral requirement altogether. Would you be willing to consider this option?"
Loan Security & Collateral,"I'll consider a co-signer. I'll have to talk to my partner and see if they're willing to help. Thanks for your time, and for considering alternative options.",We’re here to support you and find the best solution. How about I schedule a follow-up call for [specific date/time] to check back with you and see how your discussion with your partner went? Is this time convenient for you?

Transaction Fees & Charges,"I can't believe this! I just made a small international transfer, and you charged me a ridiculous amount in fees! It's practically robbery! I'm going to switch banks if this keeps happening!",I’m truly sorry for the frustration this fee has caused you. We value your business and want to make this right. Could you please tell me the amount you transferred and the country you sent it to? I’ll look into this immediately.
Transaction Fees & Charges,"It was £200 to my sister in the US! I used to bank with [previous bank name], and they charged me a fraction of this! You're taking advantage of people!","Thank you for sharing that information. The fee you see is for the express transfer service, which ensures your funds reach the recipient faster but incurs higher costs. For a transfer like yours, a fee of £XX was applied. However, using our standard transfer option, the fee would have been £YY, with a slightly longer processing time. I’ll waive the fee for your recent transaction as a one-time courtesy. Let's ensure your future transfers are more cost-effective."
Transaction Fees & Charges,"More information? No, I don't want more information! I want to know why you charge so much! This is outrageous! I'm about to close my account and move all my money elsewhere!","The fee you encountered was for our express transfer service for faster processing times, but we have a standard option with lower fees and a longer processing period to better suit your needs. As a goodwill gesture, I’ve refunded the fee for your recent transfer. I’d also like to offer you a custom solution tailored to your frequent transfers, which reduces future fees significantly. We are transparent with our fees, and I’ll help ensure the process is clearer for you moving forward."
Transaction Fees & Charges,"A one-time waiver? That's not enough! I want a permanent solution, not a band-aid! You need to address this issue with your fees! I'm not happy with your service, and I'm serious about closing my account!","Your feedback is crucial in helping us improve. I’ll arrange a personalized transfer package offering lower fees going forward. Additionally, our team is working on implementing clearer notifications and explanations during transactions to ensure full transparency. I’ll also escalate your case to our customer relations team for further discussion and options."
Transaction Fees & Charges,"Hey, I just got charged a ridiculous fee on my international transfer! I've never seen this before! What the heck is going on? I thought Jupiter was all about transparency and no hidden fees. This is a scam!",Transparency is very important to us. Could you let me know the amount you transferred and the country it was sent to so I can verify the details and clarify what happened?
Transaction Fees & Charges,"A small fee? It's more than 10% of the amount I sent! That's not small, that's daylight robbery! I've never been charged this much before. What happened to no hidden fees? I'm going to switch banks if this is how you treat your customers!","The significant fee was due to opting for the express transfer service, which is designed for urgent transactions. We also have a standard service that incurs lower fees. I’ve initiated a full refund for this fee and will ensure you have all the information required to avoid such fees in the future. Additionally, I’ve credited your account with XX loyalty points. We’re committed to improving clarity in our fee structure and your next transaction will clearly outline the costs involved."
Transaction Fees & Charges,"Faster processing? Who needs faster processing when you're getting ripped off with these outrageous fees? You're not explaining anything! I'm demanding a refund for this fee. I'm not paying this! You're lying about transparency, and I'm going to tell everyone about this.","I’ve processed a refund for your transaction fee and set up a personalized follow-up next week to discuss more cost-effective transfer options. We're also enhancing our notification system to ensure every step is transparent before confirming any future transactions. Your feedback matters and helps us improve, so thank you for voicing this."

You messed this up big time, and you're going to pay the price for it!",Thank you for your patience.
